# 📘 Initial Plan Creation Rule: complete-plan.md

## Step 1: Create `complete-plan.md`
- Generate a high-level **master plan** for the full scope of the project.
- Include only top-level objectives, feature groups, or deliverables.
- Organize using nested bullet points or headings as needed for clarity.

## Step 2: Lock the File
- Once created, this file should be treated as a **frozen record** of intended scope.
- It may **not** be edited, appended to, or reorganized unless the user explicitly provides instructions to do so.

## Step 3: Commit to Memory
- Add the `complete-plan.md` to long-term memory.
- All future `granular-plan.md` files must be created based on what has or hasn’t been completed from this file.

> ❗This rule should be executed only once, at the very beginning of a new project.
