# ðŸš€ Conversation Initialization Instructions

## Step 1: Review Prior Work
- Load `complete-plan.md` and 'plan.md' from project directory.
- Use this as your authoritative reference for high-level milestones.

## Step 2: Create a New Granular Plan
- Based on what is marked as complete in `complete-plan.md`, generate a new `granular-plan.md` with number version (example granular-plan2) file scoped **only to this conversation**.
- This new file must include:
  - Specific, actionable tasks.
  - Enough detail to track meaningful progress.
  - Only content relevant to this sessionâ€™s scope.

## Step 3: Memory Commitment
- Add both `complete-plan.md` and the newly generated `granular-plan.md` to memory.
- Do NOT modify either file without an explicit command to do so.
- Use them as authoritative references throughout the session.

> Reminder: `granular-plan.md` is frozen once created, unless explicitly asked to update it.
