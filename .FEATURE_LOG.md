  - Implemented skeleton loading screens (`VehicleCardSkeleton`, `VehicleDetailSkeleton`) for `VehicleListPage` and `VehicleDetailPage` to improve perceived performance and user experience during data fetching.
- **360° Image Viewer:** Added a `Panorama360Viewer` component allowing users to interactively view panoramic images of vehicles by dragging or using navigation buttons.
- **Improved Typing:** Introduced specific TypeScript interfaces (`Vehicle`, `VehicleContent`) and types (`VehicleStatus`) to replace `any` types, enhancing code quality and maintainability in vehicle-related components.
- **Accessibility:** Improved accessibility of the email template selector in `VehicleDetailPage` by adding `title` and `aria-label` attributes.

- **ENHANCED**: Instagram caption generation (`generateInstagramCaption`) now produces more visually focused and concise content, highlighting key features, promoting 360° views via 'link in bio', and utilizing a broader, more dynamic set of relevant hashtags.
