# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]
- Added "Generate All Content" endpoint and frontend button on VehicleDetailPage.

## [0.1.1] - 2025-06-14

### Added (Backend)
- **NEW**: Created `backend/src/services/contentGenerator.ts` with initial structure for platform-specific content generation (Facebook, Instagram, X, YouTube Shorts, Email) and 360째 image detection utility.

### Changed (Backend)
- **MODIFIED**: Enhanced `generateFacebookPost` in `contentGenerator.ts` with more detailed templates, dynamic data weaving (color, mileage, features, description snippet), stronger CTAs, and improved hashtag generation.
- **MODIFIED**: Enhanced `generateInstagramCaption` in `contentGenerator.ts` with more engaging copy, concise feature highlights, a 'link in bio' CTA for 360째 views, and an expanded, dynamic hashtag strategy.
- **MODIFIED**: Enhanced `generateXPost` in `contentGenerator.ts` to produce concise, high-impact copy suitable for X/Twitter, including a prominent feature highlight and targeted hashtags, with basic length considerations.
- **MODIFIED**: Updated `backend/src/lib/prismaClient.ts` to use writable `DATABASE_URL` (owner credentials) by default and removed the explicit write-blocking middleware to allow updates to vehicle post-tracking fields.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-06-12

### Added
- **Frontend:**

  - `src/types/Vehicle.ts`: Defined `Vehicle`, `VehicleContent` interfaces and `VehicleStatus` type for consistent data handling.

### Changed
- **Frontend:**

  - `VehicleListPage.tsx`:
    - Integrated `VehicleCardSkeletonGrid` for an improved loading state.
