# Complete Project Plan History

## Plan – 2025-06-14 15:13

## Overall Project Status
Significant progress has been made on the backend content generation service. The service can now produce enhanced, platform-specific content for Facebook, Instagram, and X (Twitter), dynamically detecting and incorporating 360° media. The Prisma database client has been configured for write access to allow for post-tracking updates. The immediate focus is to complete the content templates for the remaining platforms and integrate the entire service into a dedicated API endpoint before beginning frontend dashboard development.

## Completed Tasks

### Backend
- [x] Set up project structure and repository.
  - [x] Implemented Prisma client and connected to Neon PostgreSQL.
  - [x] Configured backend to use writable `DATABASE_URL` and removed read-only middleware to allow for updates to specific fields.
  - [x] Built and enhanced Content Generation Engine (`contentGenerator.ts`) for Facebook, Instagram, and X, with dynamic 360° media detection.
- [x] Set up API endpoints for:
  - [x] List vehicles (GET /api/vehicles)
  - [x] Get vehicle by ID (GET /api/vehicles/:id)
  - [x] Generate content (POST /api/content/generate)
  - [x] Generate email content (POST /api/content/email)
- [x] Updated backend `.env` to use `READ_ONLY_DATABASE_URL`.
- [x] Refactored Prisma client initialization into `src/lib/prismaClient.ts` using read-only credentials.
- [x] Added read-only middleware to block write operations.
- [x] Configured database connection with read-only credentials.
- [x] Built Content Generation Engine (basic functionality).

### Frontend
- [x] Initialized React project (Vite + TypeScript).
- [x] Installed and configured frontend dependencies (React Router, React Query, etc.).
- [x] Set up project structure and environment variables.
- [x] Created base pages (ShowroomPage, DashboardPage, NotFoundPage) and set up React Router.
- [x] Implemented VehicleListPage (GET /api/vehicles).
- [x] Implemented VehicleDetailPage (GET /api/vehicles/:id).
- [x] Implemented content preview functionality.
- [x] Added copy-to-clipboard functionality.
- [x] Implemented export functionality (Text, Markdown, HTML).
- [x] Created and integrated `ErrorBoundary` component for robust error handling.
- [x] Created and integrated `LoadingSpinner` component for Suspense fallbacks.
- [x] Refined loading states with skeleton loaders:
  - [x] `VehicleCardSkeleton` for VehicleListPage.
  - [x] `VehicleDetailSkeleton` for VehicleDetailPage.
- [x] Created and integrated `Panorama360Viewer` component for interactive 360° vehicle images.
- [x] Defined TypeScript types (`Vehicle`, `VehicleContent`, `VehicleStatus`) in `src/types/Vehicle.ts`.
- [x] Replaced `any` type usage with specific types in `VehicleListPage` and `VehicleDetailPage`.
- [x] Resolved various linting and TypeScript errors, including hook placement and enum syntax.

## Next Essential Steps

### Backend: Finalize Content Generation
- [ ] **Enhance YouTube Shorts Script:** Flesh out the `generateYouTubeShortsScript` function with more detailed, scene-by-scene prompts.
- [ ] **Enhance Email Content:** Improve the `generateEmail` function with templates for different scenarios (e.g., new arrival, manager's special).
- [ ] **Implement Content Generation API Endpoint:** Create a new endpoint (e.g., `POST /api/vehicles/:id/generate-all-content`) that utilizes the `contentGenerator` service.
- [ ] **Enable Post Tracking Updates:** The new API endpoint should be capable of updating post-tracking fields (`lastFacebookPostDate`, `facebookPostId`, etc.) in the database upon content generation.

### Frontend: Dashboard & Content Management
- [ ] **Build Inventory Dashboard:** Begin creating the inventory management page (`DashboardPage.tsx`) to list vehicles.
- [ ] **Integrate Content API:** Fetch and display the generated content for a selected vehicle using the new API endpoint.
- [ ] **Add Content Actions:** Implement UI buttons for "Regenerate Content", "Copy to Clipboard", etc.

## Future Enhancements & Other Pending Tasks

### Frontend
- [ ] **Responsive Design:** Fully optimize the application for various mobile devices and screen sizes.
- [ ] **Unit Tests:** Implement unit tests for critical components and utility functions.
- [ ] **End-to-End Tests:** Create end-to-end tests for key user flows.

### Documentation
- [ ] **Create User Guide:** Develop a guide for end-users on how to use the application's features.
- [ ] **Add Extensive Code Comments:** Further improve code clarity with more detailed comments throughout the codebase.

### Testing
- [ ] **Test Responsive Design:** Conduct thorough testing on different devices and browsers once responsive design is implemented.
