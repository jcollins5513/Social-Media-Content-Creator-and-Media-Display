## React Frontend Setup Plan - Read-Only Implementation Complete

### Completed
- [x] Added read-only middleware to backend
- [x] Created ReadOnlyContext for frontend
- [x] Updated main.tsx to include ReadOnlyProvider
- [x] Created ReadOnlyBanner component
- [x] Updated MainLayout to show read-only banner
- [x] Created useReadOnlyField hook for form fields
- [x] Added README-READONLY.md documentation

### Current Status
- Backend blocks all write operations (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- Frontend shows read-only banner and disables form inputs
- Form fields automatically handle read-only state
- Comprehensive documentation is in place

### Next Steps
1. [ ] Test read-only functionality:
   - Verify banner appears
   - Check form fields are disabled
   - Confirm API write operations are blocked
2. [ ] Update individual form components to use useReadOnlyField
3. [ ] Add more specific read-only UIs where needed

### Technical Notes
- Backend uses middleware for read-only enforcement
- Frontend uses Context API for state management
- Custom hook simplifies form field handling
- Documentation is available in README-READONLY.md
